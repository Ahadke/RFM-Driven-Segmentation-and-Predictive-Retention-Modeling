# RFM-Driven-Segmentation-and-Predictive-Retention-Modeling

## Project Overview
This project focuses on understanding customer behavior using transactional retail data and translating those patterns into actionable business insights. Using historical purchase data, customers were segmented based on purchasing recency, frequency, and monetary value (RFM), followed by unsupervised clustering and retention-oriented analysis.

The goal of the project is to identify high-value customer segments, quantify their revenue contribution, and highlight segments that require targeted retention or re-engagement strategies.

## Dataset Description
**Dataset:** Online Retail II  
**Source:** Kaggle  
**Time Period Used:** 2010–2011  
**Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mashlyn/online-retail-ii-uci?utm_source=chatgpt.com

The dataset contains transactional records from a UK-based online retailer, including:

- Invoice number (transaction identifier)
- Product information
- Quantity purchased
- Transaction timestamp
- Unit price (`Price`)
- Customer identifier
- Country

Only valid, customer-identifiable revenue-generating transactions were retained for analysis.

---

## Data Preparation & Cleaning
The raw dataset required standard preprocessing before analysis:

- Removed cancelled transactions (invoices starting with `"C"`)
- Removed returns and invalid transactions (`Quantity <= 0`, `Price <= 0`)
- Dropped rows without customer identifiers
- Converted transaction timestamps to datetime
- Derived transaction-level revenue (`TotalPrice = Quantity × Price`)

This resulted in a clean transactional dataset suitable for customer-level aggregation and time-based analysis.

## Feature Engineering (RFM)
Customer behavior was summarized using the RFM framework:

- **Recency:** Days since the customer’s most recent purchase
- **Frequency:** Number of unique purchase invoices
- **Monetary:** Total revenue generated by the customer

Because retail data is highly skewed (many one-time buyers), adaptive quantile binning was used to generate robust RFM scores. These scores were combined into a composite `RFM_Score` for ranking and segmentation.

---

## Customer Segmentation
Customers were segmented using **K-Means clustering** on standardized RFM features:

- Features were scaled using `StandardScaler`
- K-Means was applied with `k = 5`
- Cluster assignments were persisted for downstream analysis and visualization

This approach grouped customers based on similarity in purchasing behavior rather than arbitrary thresholds.

---

## Results & Interpretation

### 1. Customer Segment Distribution
The segment distribution shows a highly uneven customer base:

- One dominant cluster contains the majority of customers (low to mid value)
- Smaller clusters represent niche but behaviorally distinct customer groups
- Very small clusters capture extreme behaviors (e.g., very high value or very recent customers)

This pattern is typical in retail data and highlights the importance of not treating all customers uniformly.

---

### 2. Revenue Contribution by Segment
Revenue contribution is **not proportional to customer count**:

- A single cluster contributes a disproportionate share of total revenue
- High-value clusters generate significantly more revenue per customer
- Large customer segments may contribute relatively modest revenue

This validates the business case for targeted retention and personalization rather than volume-based strategies.

---

### 3. RFM Score Distribution by Segment
RFM score distributions confirm clear behavioral separation:

- High-revenue clusters exhibit consistently high RFM scores
- Lower-value clusters show lower and more compressed score ranges
- Some clusters display wide variance, indicating mixed engagement patterns

These differences support differentiated lifecycle strategies rather than one-size-fits-all campaigns.

---

## Business Use Cases

This analysis can directly support:

- **Targeted retention campaigns** for high-value but recently inactive customers
- **Customer lifecycle management**, identifying when customers transition between segments
- **Revenue optimization**, focusing marketing spend on segments with highest ROI
- **Churn risk monitoring**, especially for clusters with declining recency
